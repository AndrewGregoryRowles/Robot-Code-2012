Robotics Code (2012): This was the code for the 2012 FRC FIRST Robotics Competition. This was my first year on Team 1876. I am very content with the functionality of the 2012 robot. The robot was able to pick up foam basketballs and shoot them into a hoop as high as 96 inches. To pick up the basketball, we designed a scoop mechanism that came down and attracted the ball. Then we had a carriage that held up to 3 basketballs. The carriage’s base oscillated up and down to bring a ball to the shooting position. Once in the shooting position, one of the drivers could change the parameters of the throwing mechanism. The parameters were: Throttle - the percentage of power that went to the thrower’s CIM motor, Launch angle - the angle at when thrower arm would reverse back to it’s original position. To determine the speed of the thrower arm, I wrote a method that finds the RPM of the arm using the change in angle and time. 

We had to complete this robot in a 6 week timeframe. However, this did not mean I was given 6 weeks to program the robot. We had to first design and manufacture the robot. The program had to be completed in a matter of hours, with minimal testing.

During the competition, the program performed without error and our team ranked 3/60.
